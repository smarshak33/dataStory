Source: Where did you get your data from?
My data is Business Formations/Applications from the United States Census Bureau.

Categories: Explain what the data included so that readers can easily follow the methodology. 

The data included:
* period-- date
* value -- business formations
* i was trying to find percent change

Parameters: What date was the data exported on, is there a geographical element? Another 

Analysis: Plainly state what you did to arrive at your figures. What categories did you add? Why did you choose certain dates?

Judgement calls and caveats: Did you omit any data (i.e. an outlier that was messing with your analysis? Something that didnâ€™t make intuitive sense to include?)


Limitations: What does your analysis not answer?

Additional resources: Links to your Github or full dataset  

Pro tip: If you had a conversation about it with your editor, or thought about it for hours, it probably belongs in the methodology
